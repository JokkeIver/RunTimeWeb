        RunTime is a running club established in 2024 by Computer Science students at Aarhus University. Our goal is to bring students together in a healthy environment—enjoying the outdoors and connecting across different academic years.

        We believe the stereotypical image of computer science students is outdated, and we aim to challenge it. What started as a weekly run has grown into a vision of building a diverse community where runners of all levels—beginners and experienced alike—can find support, be challenged, and improve.
        
        We aspire to expand, offering a variety of runs at different distances and paces to make running accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
